# Fuegian sprat ELS in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean
This repository contains code employed to assess spatio-temporal patterns of distribution and abundance of Fuegian sprat early life stages (ELS) along distinct habitats between Tierra del Fuego and Burdwood Bank. The script also includes the routine used to analyse results of particle tracking simulations across main spawning areas found in this region of the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Data will be shared on reasonable request to Virginia A. Garc√≠a Alonso: garcialonso.v.a@gmail.com
